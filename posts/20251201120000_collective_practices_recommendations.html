        <h1>Recommendations on Collective Practices</h1>
        <div class="date">1 December 2025, Helsinki, Åndrei Makarov</div>

        <p>These recommendations serve as guidelines for creating safe, respectful, and inclusive spaces in collective activities and public events. They are based on principles of mutual respect, privacy, and zero tolerance for discrimination.</p>

        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Be responsible and exercise safely.</strong> Respect the bodies and property of others, do not touch anyone or their belongings without permission. Avoid wearing strong perfumes or smoking when you go to jams, for example, so everyone can breathe freely.</li>

            <li><strong>Respect the individual choice of discipline.</strong> Different groups have a lot to offer, including different tastes. Enjoy and support others to experience and explore the art of juggling together.</li>

            <li><strong>Avoid generalizations.</strong> When expressing an opinion, do not generalize; when unsure, ask a question.</li>

            <li><strong>Correct gently, but correct.</strong> Responding politely to inappropriate or offensive language is essential to creating and maintaining a safe space and non-toxic interaction.</li>

            <li><strong>Respect confidentiality.</strong> Do not publish materials (photos, videos, audio) related to other persons without their explicit permission.</li>

            <li><strong>Respect the privacy of others.</strong> If someone shares something personal, don't share that information without permission.</li>

            <li><strong>Keep your commitments.</strong> Let others know in advance if you can't participate or get things done.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Fundamental Values</h2>
        <p>Our principles are mutual respect and respect for the privacy of everyone. Don't assume or generalize. Do not define anyone's gender identity, sexual orientation, or other individual details for them. Everyone has the right to define self or not to define self at all. Everyone is free to choose which pronouns they do not want to be called.</p>

        <p>Let's be constructive, understanding and fair to each other so that everyone feels safe to speak their mind openly. Not all terms are familiar to all of us and can mean different things to different people. Asking helps to understand and brings people "to the same page". If you make a mistake, apologize and move on.</p>

        <h2>Zero Tolerance Policy</h2>
        <p>We have zero tolerance for harassment and racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination (based on gender, race, religion, ethnicity, age, etc.).</p>

        <h2>Application</h2>
        <p>These recommendations are a hint for determining actions within the framework of public events, where the basis is a safe and responsible attitude towards each participant.</p>

        <p>Respect yourself and others, train and interact in harmony with each other.</p>
