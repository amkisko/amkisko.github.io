        <h1>LLMs as Probabilistic Medium: Between Imitation and Deviation</h1>
        <div class="date">11 November 2025, Helsinki, Åndrei Makarov</div>

        <p>Large Language Models function not as "intelligence" in the human sense, but as a new medium—malleable and variable like paint or jazz improvisation. Unlike fixed tools or rigid software, ML-driven services operate as probabilistic engines, delivering not certainty but a spectrum of plausible outputs. This stochastic nature isn't a flaw but a defining characteristic, enabling flexible, adjustable, and reconfigurable media that people can shape, direct, and experiment with rather than passively consume.</p>

        <h2>The Human Operator as Data Ninja</h2>

        <p>In this landscape, human operators must become skilled at finding and providing data to language models. Information becomes the currency for problem-solving. This role demands understanding not just prompting techniques, but how to shape, iterate, and refine probabilistic outputs into meaningful results.</p>

        <p>In professional contexts, these systems accelerate communication and automation. They function as precise assistants that don't possess truth but excel at producing working drafts, scripts, and connections—dramatically reducing time spent on repetitive or exploratory tasks. Rather than navigating traditional support channels or brittle automation, ML creates a probability-driven interaction layer where value emerges through iteration, exploration, and response shaping rather than single deterministic answers.</p>

        <p>This probability-driven nature reveals something fundamental: these systems don't operate in the realm of certainty, but in the space of ambiguity. They don't resolve questions—they generate plausible continuations. Understanding this distinction—between resolution and continuation, between certainty and probability—opens the door to seeing language models not as intelligence, but as something else entirely.</p>

        <h2>LLMs as Ambiguity Machines</h2>

        <p>Language models operate as ambiguity machines. They function outside the framework of truth and falsehood, thesis and antithesis—dialectics don't apply. They simply predict the next token in sequences. They represent the natural evolution of internet-scale data processing.</p>

        <p>Society demands clarity: "Answer! Resolve! Which is correct?" Models produce resolutions, but these are statistical approximations—encoded language stereotypes. Talent and professionalism become conflated with fluent simulation.</p>

        <p>The question isn't whether human cognition can handle ambiguity—it clearly can. The question is whether societies, enhanced by machines that autocomplete thought, can resist resolving too quickly into cliché. Language models function as cliché generators operating within ambiguity, converting uncertainty into apparent fluency.</p>

        <p>This conversion—from uncertainty to apparent fluency—happens through a mechanism that appears sophisticated but operates simply: prediction. Not reasoning, not understanding, not synthesis—just prediction. The next token, the next phrase, the next plausible continuation. This mechanism, while powerful, reveals the fundamental limitation: there is no reasoning, only prediction.</p>

        <h2>No Reasoning, Only Prediction</h2>

        <p>Language models don't reason as humans do. They don't argue, synthesize, or resolve contradictions. Stereotypes function as communicative shortcuts, and by encoding patterns from past speech, models reinforce these very patterns. They reduce ambiguity to the most probable continuation—suppressing uncertainty rather than preserving it, always providing answers, never allowing silence.</p>

        <p>Users and societies impose dialectical frameworks on model outputs, creating synthetic "debates" that don't exist in the underlying system. Dialectics don't disappear—they're externalized, manifesting in human interpretation rather than algorithmic processes. Machines scale the demand for clarity: they generate "answers" so efficiently that ambiguity appears wasteful. The risk is mistaking statistical patterns for genuine thought, professional judgment, or talent.</p>

        <p>Human institutions have long conflated talent with surface polish, predating language models. These systems reveal pre-existing preferences for performance over substance rather than creating them.</p>

        <p>This revelation extends beyond individual judgment to the nature of representation itself. When prediction replaces reasoning, when statistical patterns substitute for understanding, we enter a different relationship with reality. We no longer receive copies of the world—we receive copies of copies, reflections of reflections, until the original disappears entirely. This is the realm of the simulacrum.</p>

        <h2>Copies of Copies: The Simulacrum</h2>

        <p>In the era of Large Language Models, we no longer encounter copies of reality. Instead, we receive copies of copies, circulating in statistical patterns that reflect not the world but the probability of the next plausible phrase. This isn't error—it's intentional design.</p>

        <p>This dynamic maps onto stages of representation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Faithful copy</strong> – reflects underlying reality</li>
            <li><strong>Perversion</strong> – masks and distorts that reality</li>
            <li><strong>Mask</strong> – pretends to reflect reality while concealing its absence</li>
            <li><strong>Pure simulacrum</strong> – no reference point. Only function, prediction, surface</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Language models operate at the fourth stage. There is no original—only continuation. We conflate plausibility with meaning, style with thought.</p>

        <p>When simulation exceeds its source, we enter problematic territory: artists imitate AI to satisfy audience expectations; reality becomes machine-readable aesthetics; truth becomes irrelevant unless it can be expressed as meme or prompt.</p>

        <p>In this territory, a fundamental question emerges: if machines can imitate so effectively, if simulation becomes indistinguishable from source, what distinguishes human work? The answer lies not in the quality of imitation—machines excel at that—but in the capacity for deviation. Where machines imitate, humans deviate. This distinction becomes the dividing line between automated production and human contribution.</p>

        <h2>GenAI: Imitation vs Human Deviation</h2>

        <p>This distinction raises a practical question: in a world increasingly structured by synthetic systems, what constitutes real work, and why do organizations still hire humans to perform it?</p>

        <p>Generative AI produces fluent artifacts efficiently and tirelessly. It mimics judgment, simulates reasoning, generates commands. It operates within the domain of the known, requiring prompts, patterns, and specifications. It reflects but never initiates. It detects contrast but doesn't experience tension. It processes timbre as data deviation, not emotional expression. It composes without breath.</p>

        <p>What it produces isn't understanding—it's imitation. High-resolution, statistically coherent, but fundamentally hollow. It cannot hesitate, contradict itself, or experience regret. It cannot not know.</p>

        <p>Humans, in contrast, are hired not to repeat but to deviate. We don't merely recognize patterns—we break, recombine, and reject them. We operate in the fog of undefined conflict, upstream of clarity, where no prompt exists and no specification has been agreed upon. We bear responsibility not because we're perfect, but because we're present. We carry experience—the accumulation of choices made under pressure, the memory of error, the capacity to change.</p>

        <p>We think in patterns, but we understand through friction. We shift frames, interpret contrast, and experience timbre as vibration and meaning—not as metadata.</p>

        <h2>Why People Still Pay People</h2>

        <p>Why do organizations still hire humans? Because businesses don't need more imitation. They need people who can perceive frameworks and redraw them. People who maintain state in their nervous systems, not just memory in storage. People who recognize when specifications are missing—and speak anyway.</p>

        <p>Generative AI serves as a tool for fluent continuity. Humans function as instruments of purposeful disruption. What distinguishes us isn't the ability to generate code, answers, or designs. It's the capacity to care, to deviate, to stand in uncertainty—and make it real.</p>

        <p>This appears to be a fundamental fact: humans remain essential for initiation and deviation.</p>

        <p>This essential role doesn't guarantee its recognition. In a world where machines produce fluent outputs effortlessly, where every question receives an answer, where certainty appears instantaneously, the value of human deviation becomes obscured. The machine offers the slot machine's promise: pull the lever, receive the reward. The trickster knows: the real value lies not in the reward, but in disrupting the mechanism itself.</p>

        <h2>The Slot Machine and the Trickster</h2>

        <p>A moment of coherence emerges when the machine completes half-formed thoughts plausibly. Expectation, action, result, reinforcement. Each user generation trains models to mirror the most accessible cognitive patterns—familiar narratives with updated syntax. The appearance of novelty conceals recursive cliché.</p>

        <p>Every question receives an answer, everything appears certain, and effortless articulation reinforces a sense of agency. When each output becomes a prompt for doubt, mutation, and remix, the gambler transforms into the trickster: operating the mechanism not for reassurance but for disruption.</p>

        <p>The challenge becomes converting the slot machine back into an instrument. Preserve randomness, reject complacency. Use the machine to challenge assumptions rather than reinforce them. This represents the practice of living within uncertainty—transforming probability itself into cultural practice.</p>

        <p>This transformation requires recognizing where the real uncertainty lies. The machine doesn't hallucinate—it predicts. The hallucination occurs in human interpretation, in the projection of meaning onto statistical patterns. When we mistake probability for truth, when we treat statistical approximation as genuine understanding, we enter a state of pacification: comforted by certainty that doesn't exist, satisfied by answers that don't resolve.</p>

        <h2>Probabilistic Hallucination and User-Pacification</h2>

        <p>Hallucination occurs in human interpretation—believing outputs that match desired answers. Machines don't hallucinate; they predict tokens. The projection of meaning onto statistical patterns happens in human cognition.</p>

        <p>In daily life, the influence is subtler. People treat these probabilistic systems as comfort mechanisms, trust-generating engines that pacify by filling assumptions with coherent narratives. Like slot machines, they provide immediate satisfaction—sometimes empty, sometimes transformative. This shifts behavior: reduced reliance on memory, increased dependence on generated patterns; less emphasis on definitive truth, greater acceptance of "good enough" approximations. Society adapts to machine fuzzy logic, and that fuzziness becomes the new communication norm.</p>

        <p>This adaptation raises a critical question: if machines handle routine work, if probabilistic systems provide comfort and certainty, if apprenticeship becomes automated—how do we develop the capacity for responsibility, for deviation, for initiation? The answer may lie not in resisting automation, but in creating new rituals that reintroduce meaningful risk, that develop judgment through practice, that cultivate the skills machines cannot replicate.</p>

        <h2>Rituals of Apprenticeship</h2>

        <p>A question worth exploring: can societies develop new apprenticeship rituals that reintroduce meaningful risk without fatal consequences—contemporary equivalents of the forge, the hunt, the laboratory experiment? Without such structures, responsibility may remain an uncommon skill.</p>

        <p>In creative pursuits, machine learning expands possibilities. Whether archiving conversations, creating generative art, or manipulating soundscapes, ML enables cycles of generation and re-materialization. The system doesn't deliver "finished art" but a field of possibilities—like weighted dice rolls that creators then shape into meaningful artifacts.</p>

        <p>This shaping—the human act of selecting, refining, deviating from probabilistic outputs—returns us to the fundamental distinction: machines generate, humans create. Machines provide the field of possibilities, but humans provide the judgment, the deviation, the meaning. This partnership, when understood correctly, transforms probability from a limitation into a medium—flexible, manageable, inherently open to human intervention and interpretation.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Language models function not merely as tools or oracles, but as modern media—flexible, manageable, inherently probabilistic. They transform how people work, play, and think by replacing rigid correctness with dynamic possibility. The essential tension lies between using them as spaces for genuine creativity and exploration versus falling into passive consumption of probability-shaped illusions.</p>

        <p>This represents the practice of living within uncertainty—transforming probability into culture. The challenge involves maintaining capacity for initiation and deviation, using these tools as instruments of disruption rather than pacification, and remembering that fluency differs from understanding, and style differs from thought.</p>
